# MyFirstWebsite_FreeThoughts
A personal website where I learn HTML and CSS while writing about topics I’m deeply interested in, such as procrastination, discipline, and human thinking. This project is both a learning space and a blog. Feel free to share suggestions or recommendations to help me improve my coding skills and the quality of the content.
